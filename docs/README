I want to design an experience based social media app. My objective is to incentivize Experience Organizers (which could be Businesses, Spaces or Individuals) to provide the best possible experience to the user.
Nowadays the average interaction users/customers have with the things they like involves spending money. We just go shopping, or buy something...which is a very spontaneus point of connection.

That's why I want to create this space, Experiences have a Before, a While, and an After. With this app I want users to be able to interact during the whole life cycle of an Experience, we will achieve this by using experience as content.
What's an experience? The most similar websites to this idea are just ticketing apps, or event promoting websites (like eventbrite). These websites have a different idea of experience. They usually mention Cinema Movies, Theaters, Concerts, ...
This is a very limited view of Experience and it results in Spaces being empty, or events happening twice a month. My idea of Experience involves more things, a Brand launching new products could carry an experience, a Collaboration with an artist, a simple Sale Promotion, ...

Things that at first glance doesn't seem to be an Experience but could carry one.
In other words, I think we are in a situation where both Organizers and Users are loosing Opportunity. Organizers are not taking advantage of a lot of business oportunities (selling merchandising, memberships, tickets...) and users are loosing the opportunity of knowing and learning about the things they like (graphic design history of the brand, merchandising, polls...)

Taken that into consideration, experiences are enough content to nourish a whole social media.

One of the difficulties will be stepping into a user's app portfolio. Users usually have a few social medias where they actively navigate, this portfolio is usually very stablished and stepping into it will be hard, that's why we need:

- To not Overlap other social media features, we need to be unique. A business woudn't spend resources on managing another profile when they could do everything in their existing ones.

To achieve this we need some unique and innovative features like:

- Dinamic: I want the navigation and the content to be dynamic:
	- Navigation: Introduction of a Nav Bar complementary to the notifications. This bar suggests actions to the user by learning their habits of navigation. It consists of a circle that grows the more actions it is suggesting. In order to see them, the user clicks on the circle and this one shows the actions, it would be easy to convert it into a widget or a characteristic thing of th app.
	- Content: If I want the app to take advantage of the whole Life Span of an Experience, I will need content to be fully updatable and dynamic. Sharing content between more than one organizer, using widgets to easily add and delete content...
- Personalization
	- I understand that each Organizer is very different, and with help of AI, we can avoid simplifying content to standarize, I believe that with AI it will be possible to help organizers to create a Unique experience in their own Profile Page and Content having exactly the same tools as the other ones. For this, we will need pages to be highly customizable. In other words, we want 2 different profile pages to not look like they are from the same app. Making the profile page something characteristic of an Organiser.
	- Data: This will be one of our income sources, we will take advantage of the navigation data to sell information about their experiences to the Organizers, thanks to the AI, we will contextualize each Organizer and we will be able to automatically send unique and specialised data to each Organizer, leaving behind the old standarized and general data seen in other apps.

Income: As mentioned Data will be one of the main income sources, followed by memberships/plans and adds.

Profile Pages, as said, these pages will be unique. Content wont be sorted by date, each Organizer will be able to choose how to organize it, by using customizable widgets, how many tabs, images, text, buttons...
So in a profile, the main content will be Experiences,
